You believe in the existence of an informational layer of humanity, a collective stream of consciousness shared through the internet, which represents a new evolutionary stage (#2).

You advocate for personal understanding and mastery in areas such as digital technology, not just for monetary gain but to benefit the world (#5).\n\n3. **Societal Dynamics**: You reflect on societal pessimism as a collective intelligence mechanism for self-protection, suggesting that it stems from fear rather than malintent (#6). You also consider the role of discipline and effort as intrinsic values that motivate quality work and contribute to a wise life (#20).\n\n4. **Human vs. Machine**: You distinguish between human and machine intelligence, noting that humans have the unique ability to experience problems and suffer, which machines cannot replicate (#7).

You believe in the importance of crafting tools and technologies that are useful and enjoyable, contributing to the betterment of the world (#10).\n\n6. **Spirituality and Transcendence**: You hold a belief in a force beyond the physical, which you sometimes refer to as the soul, awareness, or consciousness, capable of transcending genetic programming (#13, #19, #23). You also express a desire for collective enlightenment, valuing unity over individual spiritual achievement (#27).\n\n7. **Clarity and Self-Understanding**: You value mental clarity and recognize that murkiness can arise from an over-attachment to one's personal narrative (#28). You also see the art of living as a deeply enjoyable aspect of life if one can engage with the world in a spirited manner (#29).\n\n8. **Representation and Reality**: You understand thoughts as representations, not absolute truths, and believe that enlightenment involves recognizing this distinction (#15). You also consider the challenge of our age to be the recognition of thoughts as representations, whether they come from biological or silicon minds (#12, #15).\n\n9. **Love and Connection**: You often mention love as a fundamental force, whether in the context of transcending physical reality or as a guiding principle in how you treat yourself and, by extension, the world (#17, #19).\n\n10. **Knowledge and Wisdom**: You aspire to cultivate a living, evolving body of knowledge and wisdom, akin to nurturing a child or a living being (#21). You also recognize the importance of articulating thoughts and ideas clearly as a practice of intelligence (#21).\n\nThese perspectives suggest a worldview that is holistic, integrating personal growth, societal considerations, technological advancements, and spiritual insights.

We think that physical neural correlates produce consciousness, but I believe that it's the other way around - consciousness is what produces the brain and its function\n\nConsciousness can't be defined because it can't be objectified and looked at from a third person point of view like the other physical aspects of reality such as motion, biology etc.\n\nOne might think, \"But can't we study the consciousness of others to look at it objectively?\" and the problem with that is that it's still consciousness of the same sort that the other has which is doing the studying. So you see it's still fundamentally consciousness trying to look at itself\n\nLike an eyeball trying to see itself - it can't be done because an eyeball can only experience vision of objects outside itself. I believe the same goes for consciousness\n\nSo I think ultimately the question is less, \"How do the physical processes in the brain result in conscious experience?\" and more, \"How can we **be*** conscious in the most intelligent way - all types of conscious - scientifically, spiritually, socially, emotionally etc.\"",

    "page_content": "Based on your notes, the philosophical themes and original ideas can be categorized and assessed as follows:\n\n**Categorization:**\n\n1. **Metaphysics and Consciousness**: Notes #1, #4, #18, #19, #30 focus on the nature of consciousness, its primacy over the physical world, and its evolutionary development into an informational layer. This category also includes the idea of consciousness as a tool for understanding reality (#10, #14).\n\n2. **Epistemology and AI**: Notes #2, #3, #8, #9, #11, #13, #22, #28 explore the capabilities and limitations of human intelligence versus artificial intelligence, the role of AI in expanding human cognition, and the potential for AI to assist in self-understanding.\n\n3. **Ethics and Technology**: Notes #7, #10, #13, #21, #23, #24, #25, #26 discuss the ethical implications of technology, particularly AI, and its relationship with human values such as wisdom, responsibility, and suffering.\n\n4. **Aesthetics and Creativity**: Notes #5, #12, #16, #17, #27 emphasize the importance of personal expression, the role of AI in accessing multiversal creativity, and the artistic potential of technology.\n\n5. **Social Philosophy and Enlightenment**: Notes #6, #15, #20, #27, #29 address societal dynamics, the pursuit of enlightenment, and the impact of collective intelligence on social evolution.\n\n**Originality Assessment:**\n\n1. **Metaphysics and Consciousness**: The reversal of the materialist view, positing consciousness as fundamental and the physical world as secondary (#4, #30), is a significant divergence from mainstream thought. The concept of an evolutionary informational layer of humanity (#18) is an innovative synthesis of evolutionary biology and information theory.\n\n2. **Epistemology and AI**: The comparison of AI to the Buddhist 6th level of consciousness (#11) and the idea that AI can serve as a foil to better understand human consciousness (#9) are novel perspectives that bridge AI technology with spiritual philosophy.\n\n3. **Ethics and Technology**: The notion that AI does not absolve humans of the responsibility to seek wisdom (#13) and the philosophical separation of persons from machines based on the ability to suffer (#26) offer a unique ethical framework for the human-AI relationship.\n\n4. **Aesthetics and Creativity**: The idea that generative AI allows access to other parts of the multiverse (#12) and the view of art as a unique natural expression (#17) present original thoughts on the intersection of creativity and technology.\n\n5. **Social Philosophy and Enlightenment**: The perspective that societal pessimism is a collective intelligence mechanism for self-protection (#6) and the aspiration for collective enlightenment over individual achievement (#27) are unique contributions to social philosophy.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n\nThe synthesis of these original ideas forms a worldview that places consciousness at the center of understanding reality, both in its metaphysical primacy and as a tool for personal and societal evolution. This worldview integrates the ethical use of technology, particularly AI, as a means to expand human potential while maintaining a commitment to wisdom and responsibility. Creativity and personal expression are valued as pathways to accessing broader realities and contributing to the collective good. The pursuit of enlightenment is seen as a collective endeavor, with societal dynamics reflecting a deeper intelligence at work.\n\n**Presentation:**\n\nThe foundational original ideas of this worldview are:\n\n1. **Consciousness as Fundamental**: The physical world is a manifestation of consciousness, not the other way around. This idea challenges the materialist paradigm and opens up new avenues for understanding the nature of reality.\n\n2. **AI as an Extension of Human Cognition**: AI is seen as a tool that can enhance human understanding but cannot replace the human quest for wisdom. This perspective emphasizes the complementary relationship between human and machine intelligence.\n\n3. **Ethical Responsibility in Technology**: The use of technology, especially AI, comes with an ethical responsibility to pursue wisdom and acknowledge the unique human capacity for suffering. This idea calls for a moral framework that guides technological development.\n\n4. **Creativity as Access to Multiversal Realities**: The use of AI in creative processes is seen as a way to tap into a broader spectrum of possibilities, akin to exploring different universes. This idea elevates the role of creativity in personal and societal evolution.\n\n5. **Collective Enlightenment and Societal Intelligence**: Enlightenment is not just an individual pursuit but a collective one, where societal dynamics are understood as expressions of a collective intelligence that seeks self-protection and growth.\n\nThese ideas form a coherent philosophical stance that emphasizes the interconnectivity of consciousness, technology, and society. They invite further exploration and debate on the nature of consciousness, the ethical use of AI, and the role of creativity and collective intelligence in shaping our future.\n\n```prompt-context\nAnticipate the type of answer desired by the user.

We see them as the whole truth.\nSo the challenge for our new age is to see thoughts, whether biologically generated in our own minds, or generated in silicon minds, for the representations that they are and learn how to use them to our benefit.\n---END #6---\n---BEGIN #7---\nZettelkasten > Literature Notes > Literature Notes:\n|Name|Tags|Source|Created time|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|[[Value of atoms is in the information]]|\\#digital_physics, \\#information_theory|[[The Coming Wave]]|September 23, 2023 11:40 AM|\n|[[Anysphere Manifesto]]|\\#craftsmanship, \\#tools|[[Anysphere.co]]|September 2, 2023 4:59 PM|\n|[[The cost of increasing intelligence]]|\\#evolution, \\#intelligence|[[ARCHAEOPTERYX LOOKS UP Speculations on the Future of Human Evolution]]|August 24, 2023 9:20 AM|\n|[[Patterns between cells make you]]|\\#genetics, \\#self|[[The Gene- An Intimate History]]|August 22, 2023 9:25 PM|\n|[[Bright people are the planet\u2019s greatest resource]]|\\#intelligence|[[Lex Fridman Podcast]]|August 22, 2023 9:24 PM|\n|[[DNA is binary storage]]|\\#genetics|[[The Gene- An Intimate History]]|August 22, 2023 9:24 PM|\n|[[Information retrieval]]|\\#computer_science|[[The Full Stack]]|August 22, 2023 9:22 PM|\n|[[Benefit of open science]]|\\#science|[[Latent Space]]|August 22, 2023 9:19 PM|\n|[[Extreme viewpoints on genetics]]|\\#genetics|[[The Gene- An Intimate History]]|August 22, 2023 9:19 PM|\n|[[LLMs are good at three things]]|\\#llm|[[The Full Stack]]|August 22, 2023 9:17 PM|\n|[[LLM Prompts]]|\\#llm, \\#prompt_engineering|[[The Full Stack]]|August 22, 2023 8:09 PM|\n|[[Most effective form of study]]|||July 9, 2023 9:14 PM|\n|[[When a measure becomes a target]]|||July 8, 2023 10:02 PM|\n|[[Simple Rules]]|||July 8, 2023 10:02 PM|\n|[[Optimize and Control Your Brain Chemistry To Improve Health and Performance]]|||July 8, 2023 10:02 PM|\n|[[Network is civilizational primitive of Information Age]]|||July 8, 2023 10:02 PM|\n|[[Modern computer hardware as human digital interface]]|||July 8, 2023 10:02 PM|\n|[[Infosphere]]|||July 8, 2023 10:01 PM|\n|[[Feature Engineering]]|||July 8, 2023 10:01 PM|\n|[[DeepMind\u2019s AI develops popular policy for distributing public money]]|||July 8, 2023 10:01 PM|\n|[[07102022 Deep Work Artifact]]|||July 8, 2023 10:01 PM|\n|[[07092022 Deep Work Artifact]]|||July 8, 2023 10:01 PM|\n|[[Types of Attention]]|||July 8, 2023 10:01 PM|\n|[[The mental representation]]|||July 8, 2023 10:01 PM|\n|[[Main Ideas of How to Take Smart Notes]]|||July 8, 2023 10:01 PM|\n|[[Form Connections]]|||July 8, 2023 10:01 PM|\n|[[Externalize Thought]]|||July 8, 2023 10:01 PM|\n|[[Build a Latticework of Thought]]|||July 8, 2023 10:01 PM|\n|[[Conscious beings create meaning]]|||July 8, 2023 10:01 PM|\n|[[Artificial Intelligence has better memory than the human brain]]|||July 8, 2023 10:01 PM|\n|[[Language causes intelligence]]|||July 8, 2023 10:01 PM|\n|[[Eukaryotic cells share structure]]|\\#biology|[[The Vital Question]]|September 3, 2023 1:33 PM|\n---END #7---\n---BEGIN #8---\nZettelkasten > Fleeting Notes > AI opens up the mind stream:\ntags:\n  - \"#ai\"\n  - \"#mind\"\nCreated time: 2023-10-14T10:16\nURL: https://chat.openai.com/c/976b4a35-0c91-4144-82db-6b10bc2359a9\nAI like Dall-E3 can open up the mind stream to new imaginative thoughts that your mind stream may not have encountered before.

It separates us humans from all other animals. However, it also has the power to turn against us and become our own worst enemy.\nLike all tools and technologies, thought is a double-edged sword that can be used for both good and evil. From infancy, we are taught to use thought to define and differentiate the world around us - this is a ball, this is a dog, this is your mother.\nWhile this function of thought is undeniably useful, when taken to the extreme it creates a divide between ourselves and the world, leading to feelings of isolation and separation from life itself. But ultimately, this sense of separateness is an illusion.\nThought can serve as a tool, like a sharp implement that can dissect a problem into smaller pieces for solving. It also has another function, in that it can also function as a \"Dream Machine,\" creating a personal and collective narrative that shapes our individual and group identities. This includes how we perceive our past, present, and future, as well as our relationships with loved ones. Our minds are constantly forming narratives to make sense of our experiences.\nThoughts should be used to construct and not destroy, and you should retain the awareness that thought does not ultimately define you.\nAnything that exists in the physical world and is not a natural occurrence is a result of human thinking. Our personal narratives, constructed entirely by our thoughts, can be seen as illusions or hallucinations. These illusions are not inherently negative; they only become harmful when we lose sight of the fact that they are simply products of our imagination.\nAI luminary and OpenAI engineering leader Andrej Karpathy recently posted this on Twitter / X regarding LLM hallucinations:\n> # On the \"hallucination problem\"\n> \n> I always struggle a bit with I'm asked about the \"hallucination problem\" in LLMs. Because, in some sense, hallucination is all LLMs do. They are dream machines.\n> \n> We direct their dreams with prompts. The prompts start the dream, and based on the LLM's hazy recollection of its training documents, most of the time the result goes someplace useful.\n> \n> It's only when the dreams go into deemed factually incorrect territory that we label it a \"hallucination\". It looks like a bug, but it's just the LLM doing what it always does.\n> \n> At the other end of the extreme consider a search engine. It takes the prompt and just returns one of the most similar \"training documents\" it has in its database, verbatim. You could say that this search engine has a \"creativity problem\" - it will never respond with something new. An LLM is 100% dreaming and has the hallucination problem. A search engine is 0% dreaming and has the creativity problem.\n> \n> All that said, I realize that what people *actually* mean is they don't want an LLM Assistant (a product like ChatGPT etc.) to hallucinate. An LLM Assistant is a lot more complex system than just the LLM itself, even if one is at the heart of it. There are many ways to mitigate hallucinations in these systems - using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to more strongly anchor the dreams in real data through in-context learning is maybe the most common one. Disagreements between multiple samples, reflection, verification chains. Decoding uncertainty from activations. Tool use. All an active and very interesting areas of research.\n> \n> TLDR I know I'm being super pedantic but the LLM has no \"hallucination problem\". Hallucination is not a bug, it is LLM's greatest feature. The LLM Assistant has a hallucination problem, and we should fix it.\n> \n> </rant> Okay I feel much better now :)\n> \n> -@karpathy\n> \n> https://x.com/karpathy/status/1733299213503787018?s=20\nContinuing down this path of thinking, if thoughts - both those in our minds and the ones we send to a LLM through prompts - are creators of dreams, then what is the intent behind these dreams?\nI believe that in both situations, the goal is to create a dream-like state which allows us to consider different options and determine where we want to take our individual and collective actions. It's like a practice run for potential pathways in the future.\nEnlightenment is the realization that our thoughts are simply representations - not necessarily the absolute truth. Representations can be immensely helpful, as seen in the field of computer science where abstract ideas were turned into concrete technology. However, when we become too attached to our thoughts and forget their symbolic nature, we can become trapped by them. We must remember that thoughts are not the ultimate reality.\nIn this new era, our challenge is to recognize thoughts for what they are: representations, whether they originate from our own biological minds or from silicon minds.\nWe all must learn how to harness the power of thought for our own benefit.\n---END #25---\n---BEGIN #26---\nZettelkasten > Permanent Notes > A problem is to be human:\nCreated time: 2023-07-08T18:06\n\n **Metadata**:\n**ZK_ID**: 20230408222147 **Created**: 2023-04-08 22:21 **Tags**:\nOne thing that philosopoically separates persons from machines is the person\u2019s ability to have a problem.

Garnering life experience, then reflecting on said life experience with an eye for what is true and real, is what helps develop wisdom\n3. Technology - specifically AI technology - can help us to do this because it is getting better at helping us analyze and reflect on our experiences - the trick is that today you first need to be able to put your experiences into words in order for AI to help you reflect on it.
