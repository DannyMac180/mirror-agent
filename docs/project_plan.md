# Mirror Agent: Project Plan

## Overview

The **Mirror Agent** is an AI assistant concept that aims to help users understand themselves better by providing Socratic guidance, personalized reflection, and memory-based interactions. The agent is:

- **Model-agnostic**: The user chooses which LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, or other) is used under the hood.
- **Socratic and reflective**: Encourages users to explore their own thoughts and feelings by asking open-ended questions and delivering feedback to foster self-discovery.
- **Memory-enhanced**: Maintains user-specific context, conversation history, and documents for more personalized and coherent interactions.
- **Extensible**: Utilizes a retriever to access additional documents/files and a reflection module that adds ‚Äúself-awareness‚Äù to the agent, making interactions more meaningful over time.

Based on the attached design sketch and the [LangGraph documentation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/), this plan outlines the goals and phases for building the Mirror Agent.

## High-Level Architecture

1. **User Interface**  
   - **Chat, Audio, and Video Interfaces** to handle multi-modal inputs/outputs.  
   - This layer mediates between the user and the Mirror Agent core.

2. **Mirror Agent**  
   - **LLM layer**: Model-agnostic, can be replaced with any preferred LLM backend (OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, etc.).  
   - **Core logic**: Orchestrates requests between user, retriever, memory, and the reflection module.  
   - **Personality/Persona**: A helpful, wise, and Socratic guide that encourages introspection.

3. **Retriever**  
   - **Document/file ingestion**: Allows the user to connect external docs or files that the agent can reference.  
   - **Retrieval**: Looks up relevant information from user-provided or previously stored documents.

4. **Memory**  
   - **User profile and context**: Continuously updated with user interactions and introspective data.  
   - **Conversation logs**: Preserves logs of interactions for personalized, coherent responses.

5. **Reflector**  
   - **Reflection system**: Summarizes recent context, learns from user interactions, and provides introspective insights.  
   - **Integration**: Periodically surfaces reflections or prompts the user with clarifying questions based on memory and docs.

6. **LangGraph Integration**  
   - **StateGraph**: Defines the flow among the `Mirror Agent`, `Retriever`, `Memory`, `Reflector`, and user interface.  
   - **Nodes**: Each module (retriever, memory, reflection steps) is represented as a node.  
   - **Edges**: Capture the logic (e.g., ‚Äúif user requests retrieval, run retriever node‚Äù).  
   - **Conditional edges**: Decide next steps (reflection, memory update, direct user response) based on context.

## Required Aspects

1. **LLM Model Selection**
   - Configuration for each supported LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
   - Ability to switch or configure the LLM in real time or at startup.

2. **Prompt Engineering**
   - System messages for setting the Mirror Agent‚Äôs style and tone (Socratic, wise, supportive).
   - Templates for reflection, retrieving context, and memory usage.

3. **Memory Management**
   - Storage of conversation history, user metadata, and reflection output.
   - Efficient updating: only relevant aspects of memory get stored or retrieved to keep context manageable.

4. **Retriever Module**
   - Interface for uploading or referencing documents/files by the user.
   - Mechanisms to index and retrieve relevant content on-demand (e.g., semantic search or keyword-based).

5. **Reflection Module**
   - Logic for summarizing and analyzing previous user interactions.
   - Mechanisms for scheduling or triggering ‚Äúreflections‚Äù that incorporate the user‚Äôs personal patterns and documents.

6. **User Interface & Experience**
   - Chat, audio, or video-based user front-end.
   - Real-time feedback and conversation with the Mirror Agent.
   - Clear ‚Äúexplanations‚Äù or ‚Äúreflections‚Äù surfaces to the user, optionally with a togglable detail level.

7. **LangGraph Implementation**
   - `langgraph.json` or equivalent configuration to specify dependencies, environment variables, and compiled graphs.
   - **Nodes** (agent node, retriever node, memory node, reflection node) and edges for controlling the flow.
   - Deployment scripts or Docker-based solution to run the final integrated system.

8. **Deployment & Hosting**
   - Option to self-host or deploy to a cloud service (e.g., LangGraph Cloud).
   - `.env` management for sensitive keys (OpenAI, Anthropic).
   - Proper logging or monitoring for usage and debugging.

## Conclusion

By following these phases, we will develop a **Mirror Agent** capable of Socratic dialogue, memory-driven personalization, on-demand retrieval of user documents, and reflective insights. The architecture relies on **LangGraph** to orchestrate the flow, ensuring modularity, extensibility, and clarity in how each part of the system (Retriever, Memory, Reflector, LLM) interacts. Once built, the agent will provide a unique and supportive user experience aimed at deeper self-understanding.
