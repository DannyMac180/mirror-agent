Introduction Weave is a lightweight toolkit for tracking and evaluating LLM applications, built by Weights & Biases. Our goal is to bring rigor, best-practices, and composability to the inherently experimental process of developing AI applications, without introducing cognitive overhead. Get started by decorating Python functions with @weave.op() . Seriously, try the 🍪 quickstart 🍪 or You can use Weave to: Log and debug language model inputs, outputs, and traces Build rigorous, apples-to-apples evaluations for language model use cases Organize all the information generated across the LLM workflow, from experimentation to evaluations to production What's next? ​ Try the Quickstart to see Weave in action.
