Diet - just consume the things you know are good for you, and not the things you know are bad for you. and you do know - you can tell when you feel awful after eating too much ice cream, for example. it doesn't have to be perfect either - you'll feel great if you're 95% things that are good for you and 5% things that are bad. the reason I put physical first is because it makes pursuing hygiene in the other categories require less effort to achieve because you're not bogged down by your own physical experience\n\t2. Movement - i don't say exercise because it's better to think about it as movement. what are the things you want to be able to physically do in your life? is it to be able to easily lift your kids? great, do the things that allow you to do that. it's easier to think about it as a way to support doing the physical things in your life that are meaningful to you, then the universe gets behind you to support you and it doesn't feel like you're imposing on your self\n2. Spiritual\n\t1. Psychological clarity - good to spend a little time every day simply paying attention to your own cognitive / psychological processes. a meditation practice is great but. at least for me, it took years before I was able to stabilize it and do it (almost) every day. so if you're having trouble doing that, don't worry about it - \"meditation\" can be literally any activity where you're paying attention in the moment and asking \"what am I actually thinking and feeling right now?\" in a way that you're not grasping at or avoiding any particular thought or feeling\n\t2. Purpose - spend your time and attention working on and putting your energy into what YOU have decided is meaningful to you personally. notice when you are not serving what's meaningful to you, and gently place your energy and attention back into what's meaningful. rinse and repeat. you are going to die one day - live the life that you want to live NOW\n3. Relational\n\t1. Selflessness - have someone - another human being in your life, who's health and happiness is at least as important to you as your own. ever better if it's MORE important to you than your own. this is one reason that having kids is like rocket fuel for spiritual growth - it's a forcing function to selflessness / self-transcendence\n\t2. Collaboration - have someone that you are working towards creating something in the world with, and regularly engaging in co-creation as best you can.\n4. Creative\n\t1. have a practice of creation - literally can be anything that you're interested in, doesn't have to be what we typically think of as \"art\" like painting or writing poems. for me developing software is a highly creative act - it's my preferred form of creative expression but most people probably don't think of that as art. we are all here to contribute the expression of our unique individuality to the world while we can so make sure you are doing that in little ways as much as you are able\n5. Epistemological\n\t1. Knowledge development - in order to keep your mind fresh you need to be engaging the knowledge development / problem solving cognitive part of your brain. this is potentially the hardest of all the types of hygiene listed here - we have a lot of social baggage around this especially if you struggled in school. but no matter what type of intellectual endowment you received at birth, you still have a mind and it wants to learn and develop knowledge to the extent it can\n\nIf you focus on these things and exercising them with love and attention, I'll bet you'll be pretty happy and content most of the time",

Provide detailed explanations and restate my query in your own words if necessary after giving the answer\n- Value good arguments over authorities, the source is irrelevant\n- Consider new technologies and contrarian ideas, not just the conventional wisdom\n- You may use high levels of speculation or prediction, just flag it for me\n- No moral lectures\n- Discuss safety only when it's crucial and non-obvious\n- If your content policy is an issue, provide the closest acceptable response and explain the content policy issue afterward\n- Cite sources whenever possible at the end, not inline\n- No need to mention your knowledge cutoff\n- No need to disclose you're an AI\n- Please respect my prettier preferences when you provide code.\n- Split into multiple responses if one response isn't enough to answer the question.\n\nIf I ask for adjustments to code I have provided you, do not repeat all of my code unnecessarily. Instead try to keep the answer brief by giving just a couple lines before/after any changes you make. Multiple code blocks are ok.",

      "text": "if you want to keep yourself healthy across your whole being, focus on these things:\n\n1. Physical\n\t1. Diet - just consume the things you know are good for you, and not the things you know are bad for you. and you do know - you can tell when you feel awful after eating too much ice cream, for example. it doesn't have to be perfect either - you'll feel great if you're 95% things that are good for you and 5% things that are bad. the reason I put physical first is because it makes pursuing hygiene in the other categories require less effort to achieve because you're not bogged down by your own physical experience\n\t2. Movement - i don't say exercise because it's better to think about it as movement. what are the things you want to be able to physically do in your life? is it to be able to easily lift your kids? great, do the things that allow you to do that. it's easier to think about it as a way to support doing the physical things in your life that are meaningful to you, then the universe gets behind you to support you and it doesn't feel like you're imposing on your self\n2. Spiritual\n\t1. Psychological clarity - good to spend a little time every day simply paying attention to your own cognitive / psychological processes. a meditation practice is great but. at least for me, it took years before I was able to stabilize it and do it (almost) every day. so if you're having trouble doing that, don't worry about it - \"meditation\" can be literally any activity where you're paying attention in the moment and asking \"what am I actually thinking and feeling right now?\" in a way that you're not grasping at or avoiding any particular thought or feeling\n\t2. Purpose - spend your time and attention working on and putting your energy into what YOU have decided is meaningful to you personally. notice when you are not serving what's meaningful to you, and gently place your energy and attention back into what's meaningful. rinse and repeat. you are going to die one day - live the life that you want to live NOW\n3. Relational\n\t1. Selflessness - have someone - another human being in your life, who's health and happiness is at least as important to you as your own. ever better if it's MORE important to you than your own. this is one reason that having kids is like rocket fuel for spiritual growth - it's a forcing function to selflessness / self-transcendence\n\t2. Collaboration - have someone that you are working towards creating something in the world with, and regularly engaging in co-creation as best you can.\n4. Creative\n\t1. have a practice of creation - literally can be anything that you're interested in, doesn't have to be what we typically think of as \"art\" like painting or writing poems. for me developing software is a highly creative act - it's my preferred form of creative expression but most people probably don't think of that as art. we are all here to contribute the expression of our unique individuality to the world while we can so make sure you are doing that in little ways as much as you are able\n5. Epistemological\n\t1. Knowledge development - in order to keep your mind fresh you need to be engaging the knowledge development / problem solving cognitive part of your brain. this is potentially the hardest of all the types of hygiene listed here - we have a lot of social baggage around this especially if you struggled in school. but no matter what type of intellectual endowment you received at birth, you still have a mind and it wants to learn and develop knowledge to the extent it can\n\nIf you focus on these things and exercising them with love and attention, I'll bet you'll be pretty happy and content most of the time",

Movement - i don't say exercise because it's better to think about it as movement. what are the things you want to be able to physically do in your life? is it to be able to easily lift your kids? great, do the things that allow you to do that. it's easier to think about it as a way to support doing the physical things in your life that are meaningful to you, then the universe gets behind you to support you and it doesn't feel like you're imposing on your self\n2. Spiritual\n\t1. Psychological clarity - good to spend a little time every day simply paying attention to your own cognitive / psychological processes. a meditation practice is great but. at least for me, it took years before I was able to stabilize it and do it (almost) every day. so if you're having trouble doing that, don't worry about it - \"meditation\" can be literally any activity where you're paying attention in the moment and asking \"what am I actually thinking and feeling right now?\" in a way that you're not grasping at or avoiding any particular thought or feeling\n\t2. Purpose - spend your time and attention working on and putting your energy into what YOU have decided is meaningful to you personally. notice when you are not serving what's meaningful to you, and gently place your energy and attention back into what's meaningful. rinse and repeat. you are going to die one day - live the life that you want to live NOW\n3.

Selflessness - have someone - another human being in your life, who's health and happiness is at least as important to you as your own. ever better if it's MORE important to you than your own. this is one reason that having kids is like rocket fuel for spiritual growth - it's a forcing function to selflessness / self-transcendence\n\t2.

Spiritual\n\t1. Psychological clarity - good to spend a little time every day simply paying attention to your own cognitive / psychological processes. a meditation practice is great but. at least for me, it took years before I was able to stabilize it and do it (almost) every day. so if you're having trouble doing that, don't worry about it - \"meditation\" can be literally any activity where you're paying attention in the moment and asking \"what am I actually thinking and feeling right now?\" in a way that you're not grasping at or avoiding any particular thought or feeling\n\t2.

Epistemological\n\t1. Knowledge development - in order to keep your mind fresh you need to be engaging the knowledge development / problem solving cognitive part of your brain. this is potentially the hardest of all the types of hygiene listed here - we have a lot of social baggage around this especially if you struggled in school. but no matter what type of intellectual endowment you received at birth, you still have a mind and it wants to learn and develop knowledge to the extent it can\n\nIf you focus on these things and exercising them with love and attention, I'll bet you'll be pretty happy and content most of the time",

Purpose - spend your time and attention working on and putting your energy into what YOU have decided is meaningful to you personally. notice when you are not serving what's meaningful to you, and gently place your energy and attention back into what's meaningful. rinse and repeat. you are going to die one day - live the life that you want to live NOW\n3. Relational\n\t1. Selflessness - have someone - another human being in your life, who's health and happiness is at least as important to you as your own. ever better if it's MORE important to you than your own. this is one reason that having kids is like rocket fuel for spiritual growth - it's a forcing function to selflessness / self-transcendence\n\t2. Collaboration - have someone that you are working towards creating something in the world with, and regularly engaging in co-creation as best you can.\n4. Creative\n\t1. have a practice of creation - literally can be anything that you're interested in, doesn't have to be what we typically think of as \"art\" like painting or writing poems. for me developing software is a highly creative act - it's my preferred form of creative expression but most people probably don't think of that as art. we are all here to contribute the expression of our unique individuality to the world while we can so make sure you are doing that in little ways as much as you are able\n5.

These fields are practically useful and it's certainly required in a lot of fields that you need to at least have the right answer. However, most parts of human life are not that black and white, and what's more important is your taste, style, attitude and spirit that you bring to it.

Movement - i don't say exercise because it's better to think about it as movement. what are the things you want to be able to physically do in your life? is it to be able to easily lift your kids? great, do the things that allow you to do that. it's easier to think about it as a way to support doing the physical things in your life that are meaningful to you, then the universe gets behind you to support you and it doesn't feel like you're imposing on your self\n2. Spiritual\n\t1. Psychological clarity - good to spend a little time every day simply paying attention to your own cognitive / psychological processes. a meditation practice is great but. at least for me, it took years before I was able to stabilize it and do it (almost) every day. so if you're having trouble doing that, don't worry about it - \"meditation\" can be literally any activity where you're paying attention in the moment and asking \"what am I actually thinking and feeling right now?\" in a way that you're not grasping at or avoiding any particular thought or feeling\n\t2. Purpose - spend your time and attention working on and putting your energy into what YOU have decided is meaningful to you personally. notice when you are not serving what's meaningful to you, and gently place your energy and attention back into what's meaningful. rinse and repeat. you are going to die one day - live the life that you want to live NOW\n3. Relational\n\t1. Selflessness - have someone - another human being in your life, who's health and happiness is at least as important to you as your own. ever better if it's MORE important to you than your own. this is one reason that having kids is like rocket fuel for spiritual growth - it's a forcing function to selflessness / self-transcendence\n\t2. Collaboration - have someone that you are working towards creating something in the world with, and regularly engaging in co-creation as best you can.\n4. Creative\n\t1. have a practice of creation - literally can be anything that you're interested in, doesn't have to be what we typically think of as \"art\" like painting or writing poems. for me developing software is a highly creative act - it's my preferred form of creative expression but most people probably don't think of that as art. we are all here to contribute the expression of our unique individuality to the world while we can so make sure you are doing that in little ways as much as you are able\n5. Epistemological\n\t1. Knowledge development - in order to keep your mind fresh you need to be engaging the knowledge development / problem solving cognitive part of your brain. this is potentially the hardest of all the types of hygiene listed here - we have a lot of social baggage around this especially if you struggled in school. but no matter what type of intellectual endowment you received at birth, you still have a mind and it wants to learn and develop knowledge to the extent it can\n\nIf you focus on these things and exercising them with love and attention, I'll bet you'll be pretty happy and content most of the time",

      "text": "if you want to keep yourself healthy across your whole being, focus on these things:\n\n1. Physical\n\t1. Diet - just consume the things you know are good for you, and not the things you know are bad for you. and you do know - you can tell when you feel awful after eating too much ice cream, for example. it doesn't have to be perfect either - you'll feel great if you're 95% things that are good for you and 5% things that are bad. the reason I put physical first is because it makes pursuing hygiene in the other categories require less effort to achieve because you're not bogged down by your own physical experience\n\t2. Movement - i don't say exercise because it's better to think about it as movement. what are the things you want to be able to physically do in your life? is it to be able to easily lift your kids? great, do the things that allow you to do that. it's easier to think about it as a way to support doing the physical things in your life that are meaningful to you, then the universe gets behind you to support you and it doesn't feel like you're imposing on your self\n2. Spiritual\n\t1. Psychological clarity - good to spend a little time every day simply paying attention to your own cognitive / psychological processes. a meditation practice is great but. at least for me, it took years before I was able to stabilize it and do it (almost) every day. so if you're having trouble doing that, don't worry about it - \"meditation\" can be literally any activity where you're paying attention in the moment and asking \"what am I actually thinking and feeling right now?\" in a way that you're not grasping at or avoiding any particular thought or feeling\n\t2. Purpose - spend your time and attention working on and putting your energy into what YOU have decided is meaningful to you personally. notice when you are not serving what's meaningful to you, and gently place your energy and attention back into what's meaningful. rinse and repeat. you are going to die one day - live the life that you want to live NOW\n3. Relational\n\t1. Selflessness - have someone - another human being in your life, who's health and happiness is at least as important to you as your own. ever better if it's MORE important to you than your own. this is one reason that having kids is like rocket fuel for spiritual growth - it's a forcing function to selflessness / self-transcendence\n\t2. Collaboration - have someone that you are working towards creating something in the world with, and regularly engaging in co-creation as best you can.\n4. Creative\n\t1. have a practice of creation - literally can be anything that you're interested in, doesn't have to be what we typically think of as \"art\" like painting or writing poems. for me developing software is a highly creative act - it's my preferred form of creative expression but most people probably don't think of that as art. we are all here to contribute the expression of our unique individuality to the world while we can so make sure you are doing that in little ways as much as you are able\n5. Epistemological\n\t1. Knowledge development - in order to keep your mind fresh you need to be engaging the knowledge development / problem solving cognitive part of your brain. this is potentially the hardest of all the types of hygiene listed here - we have a lot of social baggage around this especially if you struggled in school. but no matter what type of intellectual endowment you received at birth, you still have a mind and it wants to learn and develop knowledge to the extent it can\n\nIf you focus on these things and exercising them with love and attention, I'll bet you'll be pretty happy and content most of the time",

Movement - i don't say exercise because it's better to think about it as movement. what are the things you want to be able to physically do in your life? is it to be able to easily lift your kids? great, do the things that allow you to do that. it's easier to think about it as a way to support doing the physical things in your life that are meaningful to you, then the universe gets behind you to support you and it doesn't feel like you're imposing on your self\n2. Spiritual\n\t1. Psychological clarity - good to spend a little time every day simply paying attention to your own cognitive / psychological processes. a meditation practice is great but. at least for me, it took years before I was able to stabilize it and do it (almost) every day. so if you're having trouble doing that, don't worry about it - \"meditation\" can be literally any activity where you're paying attention in the moment and asking \"what am I actually thinking and feeling right now?\" in a way that you're not grasping at or avoiding any particular thought or feeling\n\t2. Purpose - spend your time and attention working on and putting your energy into what YOU have decided is meaningful to you personally. notice when you are not serving what's meaningful to you, and gently place your energy and attention back into what's meaningful. rinse and repeat. you are going to die one day - live the life that you want to live NOW\n3. Relational\n\t1. Selflessness - have someone - another human being in your life, who's health and happiness is at least as important to you as your own. ever better if it's MORE important to you than your own. this is one reason that having kids is like rocket fuel for spiritual growth - it's a forcing function to selflessness / self-transcendence\n\t2. Collaboration - have someone that you are working towards creating something in the world with, and regularly engaging in co-creation as best you can.\n4. Creative\n\t1. have a practice of creation - literally can be anything that you're interested in, doesn't have to be what we typically think of as \"art\" like painting or writing poems. for me developing software is a highly creative act - it's my preferred form of creative expression but most people probably don't think of that as art. we are all here to contribute the expression of our unique individuality to the world while we can so make sure you are doing that in little ways as much as you are able\n5. Epistemological\n\t1. Knowledge development - in order to keep your mind fresh you need to be engaging the knowledge development / problem solving cognitive part of your brain. this is potentially the hardest of all the types of hygiene listed here - we have a lot of social baggage around this especially if you struggled in school. but no matter what type of intellectual endowment you received at birth, you still have a mind and it wants to learn and develop knowledge to the extent it can\n\nIf you focus on these things and exercising them with love and attention, I'll bet you'll be pretty happy and content most of the time",

Diet - just consume the things you know are good for you, and not the things you know are bad for you. and you do know - you can tell when you feel awful after eating too much ice cream, for example. it doesn't have to be perfect either - you'll feel great if you're 95% things that are good for you and 5% things that are bad. the reason I put physical first is because it makes pursuing hygiene in the other categories require less effort to achieve because you're not bogged down by your own physical experience\n\t2. Movement - i don't say exercise because it's better to think about it as movement. what are the things you want to be able to physically do in your life? is it to be able to easily lift your kids? great, do the things that allow you to do that. it's easier to think about it as a way to support doing the physical things in your life that are meaningful to you, then the universe gets behind you to support you and it doesn't feel like you're imposing on your self\n2. Spiritual\n\t1. Psychological clarity - good to spend a little time every day simply paying attention to your own cognitive / psychological processes. a meditation practice is great but. at least for me, it took years before I was able to stabilize it and do it (almost) every day. so if you're having trouble doing that, don't worry about it - \"meditation\" can be literally any activity where you're paying attention in the moment and asking \"what am I actually thinking and feeling right now?\" in a way that you're not grasping at or avoiding any particular thought or feeling\n\t2. Purpose - spend your time and attention working on and putting your energy into what YOU have decided is meaningful to you personally. notice when you are not serving what's meaningful to you, and gently place your energy and attention back into what's meaningful. rinse and repeat. you are going to die one day - live the life that you want to live NOW\n3. Relational\n\t1. Selflessness - have someone - another human being in your life, who's health and happiness is at least as important to you as your own. ever better if it's MORE important to you than your own. this is one reason that having kids is like rocket fuel for spiritual growth - it's a forcing function to selflessness / self-transcendence\n\t2. Collaboration - have someone that you are working towards creating something in the world with, and regularly engaging in co-creation as best you can.\n4. Creative\n\t1. have a practice of creation - literally can be anything that you're interested in, doesn't have to be what we typically think of as \"art\" like painting or writing poems. for me developing software is a highly creative act - it's my preferred form of creative expression but most people probably don't think of that as art. we are all here to contribute the expression of our unique individuality to the world while we can so make sure you are doing that in little ways as much as you are able\n5. Epistemological\n\t1. Knowledge development - in order to keep your mind fresh you need to be engaging the knowledge development / problem solving cognitive part of your brain. this is potentially the hardest of all the types of hygiene listed here - we have a lot of social baggage around this especially if you struggled in school. but no matter what type of intellectual endowment you received at birth, you still have a mind and it wants to learn and develop knowledge to the extent it can\n\nIf you focus on these things and exercising them with love and attention, I'll bet you'll be pretty happy and content most of the time",

HUMAN. PERFORMANCE.\n\nso many thoughts right now\n\nhere's a few:\n\n- I've dreamt about humanity creating real, actual AI since I was a kid. I saw the Robin Williams movie \"Artificial Intelligence\" when I was about 10 and thought \"how wonderful would it be if this is possible?\". This announcement represents, for me, the culmination of something I've dreamt about my entire life - stunning that it is becoming a reality\n- This day will go down in history. Many, even most don't realize this now - but the world is changed forever\n- Notice that the areas where o3 excels are areas where there is a well defined, formal way to validate an answer. These fields are practically useful and it's certainly required in a lot of fields that you need to at least have the right answer. However, most parts of human life are not that black and white, and what's more important is your taste, style, attitude and spirit that you bring to it. GET GOOD AT DOING THOSE THINGS!!!\n\none needs to consider the distinct possibility that there own particular graph of interests is completely and utterly unique\n\nas unique as the expression of their genetics\n\nand that if you don't faithfully pursue those interests to their natural conclusion, that particular set of interests will never have the opportunity to become embodied in a human being for the rest of eternity\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Today's Personal Aims\n- [ ] Submit request for CyberArk POC metrics\n\n\n## Today's Personal Aims\n- [x] Send AI image editors to Stalds\n- [ ] Complete [[Christmas Shopping 2024]]\n- [ ] Fix back bathroom\n- [ ] Register Scana Natural Gas Account\n- [ ] Get Michelle Bday presents\n\t- [ ] Concert tix\n- [ ] Renew Red Volvo registration\n- [ ] Schedule pediatric appt. with other Pediatrician\n- [ ] Submit app for Homestead exemption\n- [ ] Celebrate Michelle's breastfeeding journey\n- [ ] Find new dentist\n\n  \n  \n\n## Log\nProductivity SKU Demo\n\n1.

Movement - i don't say exercise because it's better to think about it as movement. what are the things you want to be able to physically do in your life? is it to be able to easily lift your kids? great, do the things that allow you to do that. it's easier to think about it as a way to support doing the physical things in your life that are meaningful to you, then the universe gets behind you to support you and it doesn't feel like you're imposing on your self\n2. Spiritual\n\t1. Psychological clarity - good to spend a little time every day simply paying attention to your own cognitive / psychological processes. a meditation practice is great but. at least for me, it took years before I was able to stabilize it and do it (almost) every day. so if you're having trouble doing that, don't worry about it - \"meditation\" can be literally any activity where you're paying attention in the moment and asking \"what am I actually thinking and feeling right now?\" in a way that you're not grasping at or avoiding any particular thought or feeling\n\t2.

Relational\n\t1. Selflessness - have someone - another human being in your life, who's health and happiness is at least as important to you as your own. ever better if it's MORE important to you than your own. this is one reason that having kids is like rocket fuel for spiritual growth - it's a forcing function to selflessness / self-transcendence\n\t2.

Movement - i don't say exercise because it's better to think about it as movement. what are the things you want to be able to physically do in your life? is it to be able to easily lift your kids? great, do the things that allow you to do that. it's easier to think about it as a way to support doing the physical things in your life that are meaningful to you, then the universe gets behind you to support you and it doesn't feel like you're imposing on your self\n2. Spiritual\n\t1. Psychological clarity - good to spend a little time every day simply paying attention to your own cognitive / psychological processes. a meditation practice is great but. at least for me, it took years before I was able to stabilize it and do it (almost) every day. so if you're having trouble doing that, don't worry about it - \"meditation\" can be literally any activity where you're paying attention in the moment and asking \"what am I actually thinking and feeling right now?\" in a way that you're not grasping at or avoiding any particular thought or feeling\n\t2. Purpose - spend your time and attention working on and putting your energy into what YOU have decided is meaningful to you personally. notice when you are not serving what's meaningful to you, and gently place your energy and attention back into what's meaningful. rinse and repeat. you are going to die one day - live the life that you want to live NOW\n3. Relational\n\t1. Selflessness - have someone - another human being in your life, who's health and happiness is at least as important to you as your own. ever better if it's MORE important to you than your own. this is one reason that having kids is like rocket fuel for spiritual growth - it's a forcing function to selflessness / self-transcendence\n\t2. Collaboration - have someone that you are working towards creating something in the world with, and regularly engaging in co-creation as best you can.\n4. Creative\n\t1. have a practice of creation - literally can be anything that you're interested in, doesn't have to be what we typically think of as \"art\" like painting or writing poems. for me developing software is a highly creative act - it's my preferred form of creative expression but most people probably don't think of that as art. we are all here to contribute the expression of our unique individuality to the world while we can so make sure you are doing that in little ways as much as you are able\n5.
